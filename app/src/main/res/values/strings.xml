        <h1>Beam Mode</h1>
        This is using android Beam, which implements NFC as a P2P solution.
        <h4>How sending works:</h4>
        Press \"Send\" to register a callback on NFC detection. On this event the input field is been read and the text is wrapped into a NDEFMessage.
        On NFC detection both devices will offer a touch screen confirmation, in which the touched one triggers the \"send\" callback.
        That means both devices could \"send\", but just the ones with registered callback will actually create and send the appropriated NDEFMessage.
        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        - Both devices can register a callback and send data after touch confirmation without collision.<br>
        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        - Android Beam does not support bi-directional data processing. In order to exchange data the devices have to connect via NFC twice.<br>

        <h1>Card Emulation Mode</h1>
        This is using plain NFC in which one device acts as smartCard and NFC reader.
        <h4>How sending works:</h4>
        Both devices act as reader and smartcard at the same time. To enable sending with an device it disables its reader mode on \"Send\" press.
        As a conclusion this device does not induct energy to recognized smardcards / nfc tags anymore and the other paired device can start reading.
        Otherwise, if both devices try to read at the same time, collision of signals avoids any communication.
        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        - Bi-directional data transmission.<br>
        - No confirmation screen.<br>
        - Can interact with any NFC-A tag - not just Android Beam.<br>
        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        - More coding required, no plain interface.<br>
        - Both devices cannot act as readers at the same time, which means an collision avoidance needs to be implemented as well. E.g. Multiplex with TDMA.<br>
